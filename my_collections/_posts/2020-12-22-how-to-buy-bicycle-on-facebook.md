People act in their own interest, if they can hide something from you, they most likely will to make the sale.

Once you buy something, there is usually no discourse available to you in terms of cooling off or buyer protection. 

Facebook is shit is dealing with issues taking no responsibility whatsoever. It says if you think there is criminal activity, contact your local police. It does let you report seller but they only select some categories as feedback, and the categories provided for you to choose from are very generic. 

Everyone is guilty until proven innocent.
