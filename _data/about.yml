intro: |
  Hi, I'm Ali Rana. 
  I'm an engineer. I love improving processes and I specialise in data analytics.

  The process could be anything. The way to deliver projects. Way to find a good property. Way to improve efficiency in teams. Or even the way to lose weight. What fills my cup is my curiousity in seeking to understand how something really works. Data and empathy are my favourite tools to get there.

  Empathy is knowledge about users or how something, that need improving, gets done. Data is all the data that is relevant for the problem at hand e.g. to measure it or to find patterns.
  
  I've worked out way to conceptualise projects that provide most value to my clients and deliver them in ways that have the highest or earliest chances of success.

  I have worked with clients in Education, Information Technology and Telco sectors delivering projects and programs using agile, waterfall or bespoke approaches.
  
  I'm particularly interested in working on data analytics, innovation for operational improvements and technology projects. Adopting a user-centric design thinking approach, I design, implement, test and transition data driven projects.

  I aim to bridge the gaps between design, tech, and the business, by working
  cross-functionally to research, prototype and deliver real products with
  effective, engaging, and accessible user experiences.
